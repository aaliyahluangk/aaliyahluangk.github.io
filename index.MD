## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
This lab was meaningful to me because it was the very first lab, and was my first time coding. Although it wasn't very technical, it showed me the basics of C++, and how to use Github, as well as how to turn assignments in. As simple as the lab was, it meant a lot to me.

Lab 4 Part 1
Part 1 of lab 4 was interesting to me because it was very mathematical. It was cool to see how my code worked when inputting measurements to a different unit. I liked how it gave us the numbers to convert, and was very straightforward. Testing the code was very interesting to me. 

Lab 12
Another lab that was interesting to me was the last lab. To me it was very different from the others with the moving image. I think it was really cool how we made the picture by deconstructing it into colors. It also meant a lot because it was the last lab we did and was the last meeting of the class.
